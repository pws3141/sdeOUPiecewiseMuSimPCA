# Simulated PCA Loadings using MLE from HadCM3 PCA Loadings

Assuming HadCM3 loadings are modelled by an Orstein-Uhlenbeck process, with the mean
a piecewise continuous function, modulus 12. That is, we assume each month has a
fixed mean, found using MLE of an OU process. The mean reversion rate is assumed
constant throughout.

Please note: the required data (the true PCA loadings) is not included in this git repo.
